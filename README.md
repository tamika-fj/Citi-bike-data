In this challenge I used citi bike data to create visualsatins with tableau after clenaing and merging the data in pandas. This repository contains the folder Tableau challenge, in this folder theere are 3 pandas files, the file labelled merging files was used to clean and edit the data previous to februrary 2021 as this was in a different format to the newer data. This data was combined, cleaned and then exported to the resources folder as a CSV called merged_old. In the merging all files pandas file I cleaned and concatinated all of the monthly data from 07/202- - 07/2023 and then exported this file as a CSV in the resources folder called merged_citi files. All of the raw data can be found in the files and older_files folder. Due to the size of the CSV file I could not upload them to git hub. The analysis of this data was then done in  tableau and can be found at this link https://public.tableau.com/shared/7WDMC5M95?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link. To complete this task I used class lectures, the tableau tim youtube channel, and the tableau website.
